# Vary Sequencing Error

The `.rds` files stored in this folder contain the estimated COI when the
sequencing error is varied. Each file is named to illustrate the level of
sequencing error used in the estimations. Estimations were run using the default
parameters for all parameters except the sequencing error, which was varied, and
the size of each bin, which was set to 50.
