# Data Outputs

This folder contains the `.rds` files generated by our analysis pipeline. For
each analysis run, we generate a raw data file and a processed data file. We run
our methods a total of ten times to ensure convergence. The raw data files
contain the results for each of the ten runs, whereas the processed data files
contain the results summarized over these ten runs.
