# Data Outputs

This folder contains the `.rds` files generated by our analysis pipeline. For
each analysis run, we generate a raw data file and a processed data file. We run
our methods a total of ten times to ensure convergence. The raw data files
contain the results for each of the ten runs, whereas the processed data files
contain the results summarized over these ten runs.

## File List

- rmcl_predictions: COI estimation for the Pf6 dataset.
- high_coi: COI estimation for samples with a COI of greater than 10. For these
  samples we assume that the data is inherently noisy and iterate over multiple
  sequencing errors to find the optimal COI estimation.
- freq_variation: COI estimation for all samples in the Pf6 dataset by iterating
  over a range of sequencing errors and finding the optimal COI estimation.
