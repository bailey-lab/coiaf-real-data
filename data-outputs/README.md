## File List

- `base_pf6`: COI estimation for the Pf6 dataset. The dataset has been filtered
  to SNPs where the MAF > 0.01 both globally and locally. Furthermore, data has
  been subsetted to sites not in linkage disequilibrium.
- `intersecting_wsafs`: COI estimation for the Pf6 dataset where data has been
  filtered to SNPs where the MAF > 0.005 both globally and locally.
- `regional_wsafs`: COI estimation for the Pf6 dataset where data has been
  filtered to SNPs where the MAF > 0.005 both locally.
