# Intermediate Files

The folder is made to hold the intermediate `.rds` files output by any
[scripts](coiaf-real-data/scripts/). These intermediate files can be combined
using the [combine_regions script](coiaf-real-data/scripts/combine_regions.R).
Note that intermediate files are not tracked by Git and are typically deleted
after they are combined together.
