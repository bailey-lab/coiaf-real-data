# Intermediate Files

The folder is made to hold the intermediate `.rds` files output by any
[scripts](https://github.com/bailey-lab/coiaf-real-data/tree/main/scripts).
These intermediate files can be combined using the [combine_regions
script](https://github.com/bailey-lab/coiaf-real-data/blob/main/scripts/combine_regions.R).
Note that intermediate files are not tracked by Git and are typically deleted
after they are combined together.
