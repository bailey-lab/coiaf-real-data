# Vary Sequencing Error

The `.rds` files stored in this folder contain the estimated COI when the
sequencing error is varied. Each file is named to illustrate the level of
sequencing error used in the estimations. Furthermore, we examine two sets of
estimations. One set uses the regression estimation method and the other uses
the bucket estimation method.
