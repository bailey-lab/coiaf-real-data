# Non Core Genome Workflow

When filtering the Pf6 data we run coiaf on, we went through several iterations,
filtering our data in different ways. Initially, we used the entire _Plasmodium
falciparum_ genome and filtered to sites that met certain inclusion criteria.
However, later on we decided to filter to sites that are part of the core genome
so that we may be more confident in the quality of reads from loci. In other
words, we ignore loci in the paralogous regions of the genome. This folder
contains a set of results found when examining all loci and not filtering to the
core genome.
